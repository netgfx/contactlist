# contactlist
A contact list implementation for web and mobile alike

<strong>Usage</strong>

Add the script in your .html/.php file

```
new contactlist();
```

### Note: The script relies on the following libraries
* TouchSwipe (http://labs.rampinteractive.co.uk/touchSwipe/demos/index.html)
* Scrollerjs (http://scrollerjs.com/)
* JQuery (https://jquery.com)

Also it relies heavily on the current html structure and css classes.
